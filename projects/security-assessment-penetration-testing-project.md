ZEH Methodology

# 🔐 Security Assessment & Penetration Testing Project  
**External & Internal Infrastructure Security Evaluation (ZEH Methodology)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents a comprehensive **security assessment and penetration testing engagement** conducted on a university-scale infrastructure. The assessment evaluated both **external-facing systems** and **internal network assets** using real-world attack simulations to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security weaknesses.

The assessment followed the **Zero Entry Hacking (ZEH)** methodology, emphasizing how attackers can exploit even minor weaknesses without prior access.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify security vulnerabilities in web applications, servers, and network services  
- Assess risks related to outdated software, weak configurations, and exposed services  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls  
- Provide actionable remediation recommendations aligned with industry best practices (OWASP, CVE, CVSS)

---

## 🧪 Assessment Scope
### Systems Tested
- **8 total systems**
  - **3 External systems**
  - **5 Internal systems**

### Environments
- Public-facing web applications
- Internal network servers
- Authentication gateways
- Database servers
- Virtualization and infrastructure services

---

## 🛠️ Methodology
The assessment followed a structured penetration testing lifecycle:

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Asset discovery (Shodan, DNS analysis)
   - Subdomain and IP enumeration
2. **Scanning**
   - Port scanning (Nmap)
   - Vulnerability scanning (Nessus, Nikto, NSE scripts)
3. **Exploitation**
   - CVE-based exploit testing (Metasploit)
4. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Privilege escalation and lateral movement analysis (if access gained)

---

## 🔍 Key Findings Summary
### Vulnerability Overview
- **13 CVEs identified across 8 hosts**
- Risk levels ranged from **Medium to Critical**
- No systems were fully compromised, but **multiple exploitable conditions existed**

### Notable Vulnerabilities
- PHP Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- OpenSSH Authentication Bypass
- OpenSSH Signal Handler RCE
- MariaDB Privilege Escalation
- Insecure HTTP headers (clickjacking, MIME sniffing)
- Exposed WordPress backup directories
- Self-signed and weak SSL/TLS certificates

---

## 📊 Assessment Results
### Exploitation Success Rate
| Category  | Systems Tested | Successfully Exploited | Rate |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|------|
| External | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| Internal | 5 | 0 | 0% |
| **Overall** | **8** | **0** | **0%** |

### Scenario Success Rate
| Environment | Scenarios Tested | Successful Findings | Rate |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|------|
| External | 3 | 2 | 66.7% |
| Internal | 5 | 3 | 60.0% |
| **Overall** | **8** | **5** | **62.5%** |

## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Penetration Testing (External & Internal)
- Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Analysis
- CVE & CVSS Interpretation
- Network & Web Application Security
- Linux & Windows Server Enumeration
- WordPress Security Auditing
- Secure Configuration Review
- Report Writing & Security Documentation

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Reconnaissance:** Shodan, DNS tools  
- **Scanning:** Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, Gobuster, WPScan  
- **Exploitation:** Metasploit Framework  
- **Protocols & Services:** HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, FTP, SMB, RDP, MariaDB  
- **Security Standards:** OWASP Top 10, CVE, CVSS  

---

## 🔐 Recommendations (High-Level)
- Patch outdated PHP, OpenSSH, Windows HTTPAPI, and MariaDB components
- Harden SSH (disable agent forwarding, enforce key-based auth, MFA)
- Remove exposed WordPress backups and default files
- Enforce secure HTTP security headers
- Replace self-signed SSL certificates with trusted CAs
- Implement network segmentation to reduce lateral movement risk
- Establish continuous vulnerability scanning and patch management

---

## 📈 Security Impact
Although no systems were fully compromised, the assessment revealed **multiple high-risk attack paths** that could be exploited by skilled attackers with internal access. Addressing these weaknesses significantly improves the organization’s **defensive posture, resilience, and attack surface reduction**.

---

## 📄 Disclaimer
This project was conducted in a controlled academic environment for educational purposes. No real-world exploitation or data misuse occurred.
