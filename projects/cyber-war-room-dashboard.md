A centralized cybersecurity War Room dashboard that monitors **your actual computer** in real-time, detecting security threats like suspicious processes, attacks, file changes, and system anomalies - alongside a comprehensive monitoring interface.

## Two Modes

### 🔴 LIVE MODE (Real Detection)
Monitors your actual laptop using a Python backend. Detects real threats on your system:

| Detection | What it looks for |
|---|---|
| **HIGH CPU** | CPU sustained over 85% |
| **HIGH RAM** | Memory usage over 85% |
| **CPU/RAM anomaly** | Statistical deviation from baseline (z-score) |
| **Suspicious processes** | mimikatz, psexec, nc, ncat, meterpreter, etc. |
| **New (non-whitelisted) processes** | Processes not in the known-good list |
| **Suspicious open ports** | Ports 4444, 1337, 31337, etc. (C2 relays) |
| **Failed logins** | Windows Security event log (Event ID 4625) |
| **Privilege escalation** | Windows Security event log (Event ID 4672) |
| **File integrity changes** | Changes to System32 config, hosts file |
| **Suspicious new files** | New .exe/.dll/.ps1/.bat files created recently |
| **New network connections** | New outbound connections against baseline |

### 🟢 MOCK MODE (Simulation)
Generates realistic simulated attacks and metrics for demos/training. No backend needed.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Live Detection)

### 1. Install dependencies (one time)
```
pip install psutil websockets
```

### 2. Start the backend
```
start_backend.bat        # Windows
# OR
python backend/main.py
```

This starts:
- **HTTP server** at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (serves the dashboard)
- **WebSocket server** at `ws://127.0.0.1:8765` (streams live telemetry)

### 3. Open the dashboard
Navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html**

The dashboard automatically connects to the WebSocket. When connected, mode shows **LIVE** in the top-right. To just view the mock version, open `index.html` directly from the file system (no backend running).

## 🖥️ Dashboard Sections

1. **Network Health** - Real network connections, listening ports, traffic rates
2. **Security Health** - Live security score from detected threats (0-100)
3. **Suspicious Activities** - Live feed of detected threats (real, from your system!)
4. **System Status** - Your actual CPU/RAM/disk and top processes
5. **Incidents** - Detected alerts as incidents with severity
6. **Critical Assets** - Your system components & suspicious files detected
7. **User Activities** - Windows login events, failed logins, privilege changes
8. **Threat Levels** - Real-time threat gauge calculated from detections
9. **Operational Readiness** - Monitoring capability and system health

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `backend/config.py` to tune:

- **THRESHOLDS** - Alert thresholds (CPU%, RAM%, failed logins)
- **whitelist_processes** - Add your trusted apps to suppress false alerts
- **suspicious_process_names** - Known bad tools to watch for
- **suspicious_ports** - Ports that indicate C2/backdoors

You can also add your own apps to the whitelist as you use the system) to reduce false positives.

---

## 🔍 Understanding Alerts

- **HIGH_RAM / HIGH_CPU** - Your system resources are under pressure (could be an attack or just heavy usage)
- **SUSPICIOUS_PROCESS** - A known hacking tool (mimikatz, netcat, etc.) is running
- **NEW_PROCESS** - A program started that isn't in the whitelist
- **SUSPICIOUS_PORT** - A port commonly used by malware is listening
- **FAILED_LOGINS** - Multiple failed login attempts (Event 4625)
- **FILE_INTEGRITY** - A monitored system file changed
- **SUSPICIOUS_FILE** - A new executable/script appeared recently

---

## 🎨 Features

- Dark military war room theme with CRT scanlines
- Real-time WebSocket streaming from your machine
- Automatic fallback to mock mode when no backend detected
- Custom canvas-drawn charts (no external libraries)
- DEFCON-style threat level indicator
- Keyboard shortcuts: `F` fullscreen, `M` refresh status
- Responsive design
